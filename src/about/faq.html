</p>

<h3>Is there a (long) break during the Fireside?</h3>
<p>
  No. The tournament is from 11.30 to 21.00. There will be short breaks between every round because we have to wait for every game to finish.
</p>

<h3>I’m a beginning player. Won’t I get eliminated from the tournament right away?</h3>
<p>
  We play a Swiss tournament without elimination. This means that players of equal skill meet every round and no one is kicked out. The tournament is fun for players of all levels!
</p>

<h3>Does my Hearthstone account have to be on the EU server?</h3>
<p>
  You can only join the tournament if your account is on the EU server. Of course, you are welcome to come for a chat and a friendly game if you are on the Americas or Asia servers.
</p>

<h3>Can I join late?</h3>
<p>
  No late admissions for any reason, sorry. If you arrive after 11.30, you cannot join the tournament.
</p>

<h3>Do I have to prepare for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. You must have 3 decks of 3 different classes in your Hearthstone account.
</p>

<h3>Are there prizes for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. We always have first and second place prizes and sometimes more. Prizes could be card packs, Blizzard goodies, gift cards and other fun stuff.
