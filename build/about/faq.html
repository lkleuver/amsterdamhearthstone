  Yes. You can only join the tournament if your account is on the EU server. Of course, you are welcome to come for a chat and a friendly game if you are on a differenct server.
</p>

<h3>Can I join late?</h3>
<p>
 Late admission is not possible. When we start the tournament at 11.30 sharp, there is no way to add new players. However, if you know you are going to be late and you contact us no later than 11.00, we could start you in round two, with an auto-loss in round one. This is only possible with explicit permission, given before 11.00.
</p>

<h3>Do I have to prepare for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. You must have 3 decks of 3 different classes in your Hearthstone account.
</p>

<h3>Are there prizes for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. We always have first and second place prizes and sometimes more. Prizes could be card packs, Blizzard goodies, gift cards and other fun stuff.
