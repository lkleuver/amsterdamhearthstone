<h3>Is there an age minimum at your events?</h3>
<p>
  Players of all ages are welcome. You do need written permission from your parents if you are under 16.
</p>

<h3>What if I get hungry?</h3>
<p>
  No problem, the pub offers dinner, snacks, sandwiches and drinks at very reasonable prices.
</p>

<h3>Will there be WiFi?</h3>
<p>
  Of course! There is a stable broadband internet connection at the Fireside. Just bring your own laptop, tablet or phone.
</p>

<h3>I don't speak Dutch. Is that a problem?</h3>

  No problem. All of our communication is in English. Also, Dutch players don't mind speaking English to you.

  It's free to come and have a chat, a drink and a friendly game. Tournament registration is &euro;5 per person.
</p>

<h3>How do I register for the Fireside Gatherings and Tournament?</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://amsterdamhearthstone.nl/fireside/">Right here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Can I come without playing the tournament?</h3>

</p>

<h3>I have an idea, suggestion or question</h3>
<p>
  Please share it with us. Contact us through <a href="mailto:amsterdamhearthstone@gmail.com">email</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amsterdamhearthstone" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/amsterdam-hearthstone-meetup/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>.
</p>

<h3>Is there a (long) break during the Fireside?</h3>
<p>
  No. The tournament is from 11.30 to 21.00. There will be short breaks between every round because we have to wait for every game to finish.
</p>

<h3>I'm a beginning player. Won't I get eliminated from the tournament right away?</h3>
<p>
  We always play Swiss tournaments without elimination. This means that players of equal skill meet every round and no one is kicked out. The tournament is fun for players of all levels!
</p>

<h3>Does my Hearthstone account have to be on the EU server?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. You can only join the tournament if your account is on the EU server. Of course, you are welcome to come for a chat and a friendly game if you are on the Americas or Asia servers.
</p>

<h3>Can I join late?</h3>
<p>
  Late admission is not possible. If you arrive after 11.30, you cannot join the tournament. However, if you know you are going to be late, please contact us before 11 (email, Facebook or Battlefy). We could give you an auto-loss for round 1 and enter you in round 2. This is only possible with explicit persmission from us, and no later than 11.00.
</p>

<h3>Do I have to prepare for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. You must have 3 decks of 3 different classes in your Hearthstone account.
</p>

<h3>Are there prizes for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. We always have first and second place prizes and sometimes more. Prizes could be card packs, Blizzard goodies, gift cards and other fun stuff.
</p>

<h3>What are the rules for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Please check the <a href="https://battlefy.com/amsterdamhearthstone/" target="_blank">BattleFy page</a> for the rules of each tournament,
