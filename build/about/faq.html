The address is De Clercqstraat 136.
</p>

<h4>Public transport</h4>
<p>
  It’s very easy and quick to get to the Fireside by public transport. Check 9292.nl for the fastest route.
</p>

<h4>Parking</h4>
<p>
  Near 2 Klaveren for either €3 (west of the bridge) or €4 (east of the bridge) per hour. It’s cheaper to park at Station Sloterdijk, using the special P+R Regeling (website).
</p>

<h3>What if I get hungry?</h3>
<p>
  No problem, the pub offers dinner, snacks, sandwiches and drinks at very reasonable prices.
</p>

<h3>Will there be WiFi?</h3>
<p>
  Of course! There is a stable broadband internet connection at the Fireside. Just bring your own laptop, tablet or phone.
</p>

<h3>I don’t speak Dutch. Is that a problem?</h3>
<p>
  No problem. All of our communication is in English. Also, Dutch players don’t mind speaking English to you.
</p>

<h3>What does the Fireside cost?</h3>
<p>
  It’s free to come and have a chat, a drink and a friendly game. Tournament registration is €4 per person.
</p>

<h3>How do I register for the Fireside Gatherings and Tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amsterdamhearthstone" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/amsterdam-hearthstone-meetup/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>. On the event page, there is a link to a Google form. Fill that in to register.
</p>

<h3>Can I come without playing the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Of course! You are always welcome for a friendly game and a chat.
</p>

<h3>I have an idea, suggestion or question</h3>
<p>
  Please share it with us. Contact us through <a href="mailto:amsterdamhearthstone@gmail.com">email</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amsterdamhearthstone" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/amsterdam-hearthstone-meetup/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>.
</p>

<h3>Is there a (long) break during the Fireside?</h3>
<p>
  No. The tournament is from 11.30 to 21.00. There will be short breaks between every round because we have to wait for every game to finish.
</p>

<h3>I’m a beginning player. Won’t I get eliminated from the tournament right away?</h3>
<p>
  We play a Swiss tournament without elimination. This means that players of equal skill meet every round and no one is kicked out. The tournament is fun for players of all levels!
</p>

<h3>Does my Hearthstone account have to be on the EU server?</h3>
<p>
  You can only join the tournament if your account is on the EU server. Of course, you are welcome to come for a chat and a friendly game if you are on the Americas or Asia servers.
</p>

<h3>Can I join late?</h3>
<p>
  No late admissions for any reason, sorry. If you arrive after 11.30, you cannot join the tournament.
</p>

<h3>Do I have to prepare for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. You must have 3 decks of 3 different classes in your Hearthstone account.
</p>

<h3>Are there prizes for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Yes. We always have first and second place prizes and sometimes more. Prizes could be card packs, Blizzard goodies, gift cards and other fun stuff.
</p>

<h3>What are the rules for the tournament?</h3>
<p>
  Please check the <a href="https://battlefy.com/amsterdamhearthstone/" target="_blank">BattleFy page</a> for the rules of each tournament,
