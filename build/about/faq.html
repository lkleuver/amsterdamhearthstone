  <h2 id="tournament">Tournament</h2>

      <h3>Can I come without playing the tournament?</h3>
      <p>
        Of course! You are always welcome for a friendly game and a chat.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I have to bring my own device?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Bring a tablet, phone or laptop to play on (and don't forget your charger!). Make sure yyour device has the latest version of Heartsthone installed. There are enough power outlets to charge your device.
      </p>

      <h3>I'm a beginning player. Won't I get eliminated from the tournament right away?</h3>
      <p>
        No, because we play <a href="#swiss">Swiss</a> :)
      </p>

      <h3>Does my Hearthstone account have to be on the EU server?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. You can only join the tournament if your account is on the EU server. Of course, you are welcome to come for a chat and a friendly game if you are on the Americas or Asia servers.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I join late?</h3>
      <p>
        Late admission to the tournament is not possible. If you arrive after the check-in ends, you cannot join the tournament. You may of course still attend to watch or play a side tournament.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I have to prepare for the tournament?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. You must have 4 decks of different classes in your Hearthstone account. These will be used in the tournament. You can't change them after the tournament has started.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a good idea to think about your deck line-strategy: which decks can I beat and which do I lose against? What do I <a href="#ban">ban</a>?
        If you are new, you should think about reading some online articles about Hearthstone tournament play. It requires a different strategy than laddered play.</a>
      </p>

      <h3>Are there prizes for the tournament?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We always have prizes for the top 4 players. Prizes could be card packs, Blizzard goodies, gift cards and other fun stuff.
      </p>

  <h2>Tournament rules</h2>

    <h3>What format do you play?</h3>
    <p>
      We usually play <em>Swiss rounds</em> and <em>Conquest</em>. But please check the <a href="http://amsterdamhearthstone.nl/fireside/">registration form</a> for the format of the tournament.
    </p>

    <h3 id="swiss">What is Swiss?</h3>
    <p>
    The structure of many tournaments is single (or double) elimination. This means you are remvoved from the tournament after losing one or two rounds. We do not like this.
    </p>
    <p>We think <em>Swiss</em> is a much better system. You are not removed after losing a round. Instead, every player plays a guaranteed number of rounds. Ususally five. The first round is paired randomnly. The second round is paired based on how you did the round before. The losers face the losers, the winners face the winners, etc. This makes for a fun tournament experience for all players of all levels.</p>
    <p>After a set number (usually five) of Swiss rounds, the top players (top 4, 6 or 8) move on to the single elimination fase to determine the winner.</p>

    <h3 id="ban">What is banning?</h3>
    <p>
    Banning is a process where you remove one of your opponents decks for that rounds. In a best-of-5, every player brings 4 decks. Only 3 decks are used every round. You opponent chooses which one.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Conquest?</h3>
